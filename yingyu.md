这个少年非常很感激，并从朋友的话里获得极大的动力。现在，他已经从沮丧中恢复过来，真正爱上了英语。

 

## 2、Different Countries Have Different Kinds of Englishes（不同的国家有不同的英语）

　　Voyages of people from England play an important part in spreading the English language. At present, English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries, such as America, Singapore, Malaysia and some African countries. All based on British English, the English spoken in these countries can be well understood by native English speakers. But actually, these Englishes have been gradually changing in accents, spellings, expressions and the usage of vocabulary.

　　Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the foreigners of your block are from. For example, if a boss fluently commands his driver, “Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs”, instead of requesting, “Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis”, you can recognize his American identity, while the latter suggests that he is British.

　 英国人的航海在英语的传播中扮演了重要的角色。目前，英语在许多国家被作为官方语言或通用语言频繁地使用，例如美国、新加波、马来西亚和一些非洲的国家。这些国家的英语都以英式英语为基础，能很好地为以英语为本族语的人所理解。但是实际上，这些英语在口音、拼写、表达和词汇的使用方面都在逐渐变化。

因为这一情况的存在，你就可以利用这些英语之间的区别说出你们街区的外国人是哪个国家来的了。例如，如果有个老板流利地命令他的司机：“Come up straight to my apartment by elevator and take some gas for my trucks and cabs(直接搭电梯到我公寓上来拿卡车和出租车的汽油)”，而不是要求说，“Please come to my flat by lift and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis(请直接搭电梯到我公寓上来拿卡车和出租车的汽油)”，你就可以轻易地辨认出他的美国人身份，而后者却暗示着那是一位英国人。

 

 

## 3、A Hard Trip（一次辛苦的旅行）

　　My sister was fond of traveling. Ever since graduating, she had been determined to organize a trip to an old temple. Since transporting fare was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there not caring about the disadvantages. Her stubborn attitude was always her shortcoming. Once she made up her mindto do something, no one could persuade her to change her mind. Finally, we gave in as usual though we preferred to take a train. After we prepared everything, including the schedule, reliable weather forecast and the insurance, we began our trip.

　Our journey was along a river flowing from a high altitude. Our pace was slow because the river frequently had many sharp bends through deep valleys, where the water seemed to boil. Just as I recorded in my journal, it was really a hard journey. But we also enjoyed great views. One night, I put my head on my pillow--a parcel of wool coats, and lay beneath the stars. When the flame in front of our cave went out at midnight, I found the sky so beautiful!

　我的妹妹很喜欢旅行。自从毕业以来，她就下定决心要组织一次往一座古庙的旅行。因为交通费用昂贵，她决定骑自行车去，毫不担心其中的不利情况。顽固的态度一直都是她的缺点，一旦她下定决心要做的事，就没有人能说服她改变主意。最后，我们像往常一样让步，尽管我们更喜欢乘火车去。我们准备好了所有东西，包括时间表、可靠的天气预报，还有保险，就开始了旅程。

　　我们的旅程沿着一条从高海拔处流下来的河流前行。但我们的步伐很慢，因为当流经深深的峡谷时，这条河流急转弯很多，急湍的河水都似乎沸腾起来。正如我在旅行日志里记录的那样，这真是一次艰苦的旅行。但是我们也欣赏到了美丽的景色。一天晚上，我把头枕在一包羊毛衣服做的枕头上，躺在星空下，当岩洞前的火焰在午夜熄灭时，我发现夜空是如此的美丽!

 

 

## 4、A Horrible Earthquake（可怕的地震）

　　Dirty water rose in wells and canals before the earthquake. But no one judged that an earthquake was coming. Suddenly, everything shook. It seemed as if the world was at an end. Millions of brick houses and a number of dams were destroyed. Railway tracks became useless bars. Pipes in mines burst and let out smelly steam. Huge cracks trapped cyclists everywhere.

The next day, this event was the headline or main title of all newspapers. With the reporters giving an outline of the disaster, the whole nation was shocked by the damage and the victim’s extreme suffering. People were moved when they read that the survivors comforted each other by saying “Congratulations! You survived!”. So they not only expressed their sympathy sincerely, but also organized together to help the victims right away. The injured were rescued and the dead were buried. The frightened survivors were dug out from under the ruins and were offered shelter, fresh water and electricity. Thanks to people’s help, the loss was minimized.

　地震前，水井和运河里的污水都涨涌起来。但是却没人判断出地震即将来临。霎那间，一切都在摇晃，似乎整个世界就要结束。数以百万的砖房和许多水坝遭到破坏;铁路轨道都变成无用的铁条;煤矿管道纷纷爆裂，发出有臭味的蒸汽;到处都有骑车的人被巨大的裂缝陷住。　第二天，所有报纸都纷纷以大字标题或主要标题报道了这一事件。记者们描述了灾难的大概情况，全国都被地震的破坏和灾民们极度的苦难所震惊。当人们读到幸存者以“恭喜啊，你还活着。”来互相安慰时，都被感动了。人们不仅衷心地表达了他们的同情，而且还立刻组织起来帮助灾民。伤员被救助了，死者被埋葬了，吓坏的幸存者被从废墟中挖出来了，栖身处、净水和电力也很快得到提供。多亏了人们的帮助，灾区的损失被减到了最小。

 

## 5、The Great President（伟大的总统）

　　As the founder of the republic, the president had many good qualities. Before coming to power, he was a generous lawyer. He was willing to selflessly help everyone who turned to him. He accepted no fee to offer legal guidance and opinions to those who were out of work or uneducated. Later, believing all mankind to be equal, he devoted himself tostopping the unfair anti-black laws. He set up the Black Youth League and was voted to be the leader. However, though he kept peaceful principles without violence and terror, his mean enemies still blew up his house and attacked his relatives, and he himself couldn’t escape being sentenced to 30 years in prison.

　　Not fearing of the prison guards’ cruelty, he kept active and begged no mercy from them. As a matter of fact, he was always hopeful and never lost heart during the stage even though he was in trouble.

　　Finally, people rewarded him with the leader’s position and a gold blanket.

　　作为共和国的创始人，这位总统具备许多的优秀品质。还在掌权之前，他就是一位慷慨的律师。他愿意无私地帮助那些向他求助的人。他免费为失业的，或没有受过教育的人提供法律指导和意见。后来，因为相信所有人类都是生来平等，他全身心投入到废除不平等的反黑人法律工作中。他建立了黑人青年团并被选为领袖。然而，尽管他坚持没有暴力、没有恐怖的和平原则，卑鄙的敌人还是炸毁了他的家、袭击了他的亲属，他自己也无法逃脱被判30年徒刑的遭遇。

　　在狱中，他毫不畏惧狱警的残酷，始终保持积极的态度，不向他们乞求怜悯。实际上，他在任何一个困境时期都充满着希望，从未灰心。

最后，人们以领袖的职位和一块金毯子回报了他的贡献。

 

## 6、A Brave Maid（勇敢的女仆）

　　A wooden vase from the Ming Dynasty at the entrance of the reception hall amazed everyone. The artists designed it in a rare style and selected valuable jewels to decorate it. People thought highly of its fancy colour of honey and the beautiful paintings on it.

　The vase used to belong to a former castle. But when the country was at war, the enemy troops exploded the castle. Debates on how the vase survived went on and on. In order to remove people’s doubt, a team of no less than 20 people carried out an informal investigation. The evidences they found showed that a maid took the vase apart and asked a sailor to sink it in a local well. She never gave away the secret even under the cruel trial of the enemies who were in search of treasures.

　It is worth giving this brave maid a fortune in return.

　　接待大厅入口处的明朝木制花瓶 使每个人都惊奇不已。艺术家以一种罕有的风格设计它，并挑选了贵重的珠宝装饰它。人们高度赞赏它那蜂蜜般的奇特颜色，还有上面绘制的绘画。

　这个花瓶曾经属于一座从前的城堡，但在战争期间，敌人的军队炸毁了城堡，于是关于这个花瓶是如何幸存下来的争论就一直在持续着。为了解开人们的疑问，一个由不少于20人的调查队开展了一次非正式的调查。他们找到的证据表明，有个女仆把花瓶拆开，然后让一名水手把它沉到当地的一个水井里。她从来没有泄露这个秘密，即使是在搜寻财宝的敌人残酷的审讯下。

　这位女仆真是值得给予一大笔钱作为对她的回报。

## 7、A Fair Competition（公平的比赛）

　　Swifter, Higher and Stronger stands for the spirit of the Olympics. But fairness is the basis of this motto. Only when you win fairly will you and your homeland deserve the great glory. But nowadays, unlike the ancient honest slave competitors, some hopeless athletes who can’t bear the pain of training cheat when taking part in games. Medals seem to have magical power causing them to cheat, and the prize money has replaced the motto as their only goal.

　So, in the gymnastics event to be held in our city next month, one of the host’s responsibilities is to keep competitions fair. They advertised on posters outside the stadium to promise that every competitor is to have a regular physical examination in a gymnasium one after another. No one can bargain on this. The volunteers in charge will be very strict. It is foolish to cheat because they will not be admitted to compete and will even be fined as well.

　“更快!更高!更强!”代表着奥运精神。但是公平却是这一格言的基础。只有当你公平地赢得比赛，你和你的祖国才会承受这样的光荣。但如今，不像古代那些诚实的奴隶参赛者，有些没有希望的运动员无法承受训练的痛苦，于是在参加比赛时作假。奖牌似乎有某种魔力使他们作假，奖金也已经代替了奥运格言成为了他们唯一的目标。

　因此，在我们市下个月即将举行的一场体操赛事中，主办方的其中一项责任就是要确保比赛的公平。他们在体育场外的海报上做广告，承诺说每个参赛者都将在体育馆一个一个地参加常规的身体检查。对此没有人可以讨价还价。负责此事的志愿者将非常严格。作假是很愚蠢的，因为他们将不被允许去竞赛，甚至还将被罚款。

 

 

## 8、Computers（电脑）

　　The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums. But with the help of new technology, electronic chips replaced tubes and a revolution of artificial intelligence has arisen. From then on, the appearance of computers totally changed our lives. They can not only download information from the wet when connected by the network or mobile phone signals, but also solve different types of logical problems. With operators as their coaches, they can even control rockets to explore the moon and instruct androids with the human race’s characters to mop floors and watch over your naughty niece. Anyhow, computers are so helpful that they do bring happiness.

However, computers are easily attacked by viruses. This reality has become a hard-to-deal with-problem. As a result, computers are dangerous in a way. So, personally, I worry about their universal applications in some fields, such as finance.

　早期计算机器的目的是简化比较难的计算。但是在新技术的帮助下，电子芯片代替了电子管，一场人工智能革命由此掀起。从那时起，电脑的出现完全改变了我们的生活，它们不仅能在网络或移动电话信号的连接下从网上下载信息，而且可以解决各种类型的逻辑问题。在操作员的教练下，它们甚至还可以控制火箭探索月球，指导具有人类性格的机器人擦洗地板和照顾你调皮的侄女。不管怎么说，电脑都是如此的有用，以致的确给人们带来了快乐。

　然而，电脑很容易受到病毒的攻击，这一现实已经成为一个难以处理的难题，结果，电脑在某种程度上是很危险的。因此，就个人而言，我很担心电脑在某些领域，例如金融方面的广泛应用。

 

 

 

## 9、Wildlife Protection（保护野生动植物）

Dinosaurs died out because of an unexpected incident. But wildlife today disappears or is in danger just because humans do harm to it. For example, tigers are hunted for fur to make carpets so that they can only live in secure reserves; grassland is destroyed without mercy so that dust storms come into being affecting distant cities.

　　Last year, scientists saw some monkeys rubbing themselves with a certain kind of insects to protect themselves from fierce mosquitoes biting. According to the result of the inspection, they found that the insect contains a powerful drug, so local farmers were employed to catch the insects. The ending was that the insects disappeared from the whole zone. When told that it was a loss to humans, the farmers burst into laughter and responded, “Our real loss is our decreasing income.”

　　We should appreciate the natural balance and pay more attention to the importance of wildlife protection. Not until we succeed in letting wildlife live in peace, can we smile in relief.

　　恐龙因一次意外事件而灭绝，但是今天的野生动植物却是因为人类的伤害而消失或处在危险中。例如，老虎被猎杀以获取做地毯的皮毛，以致它们只能生活在安全的保护区里;草地被毫不怜悯地破坏，以致沙尘暴开始影响遥远的城市。

　　去年，科学家观察到猴子在身上擦某种昆虫来保护自己不受凶猛的蚊子的叮咬。根据检查的结果，他们发现这种昆虫含有一种具有强大效力的药物，于是，当地的农民都被雇来抓虫子。结果是，这种昆虫从这整个地区都消失了。当被告知说这是整个人类的损失时，农民们都突然大笑着回应道：“我们减少的收入才是我们真正的损失呢!”

　　我们应该意识到自然平衡的重要，更加注意野生动植物的保护。直到我们成功让野生动植物安详平静地生活，我们自己才能如释重负地笑开颜。

 

 

## 10、My First Band（我的第一支乐队）

　　I was very sensitive to music. Just dipping into the music books briefly, I could sing or play well. To be honest, I always dreamt of becoming a famous folk actor. I was so confident that I never decreased my devotion.

I formed my first band called “Rolling Frog”. At the beginning, we relied on performing on instruments in pubs or to passers –by to earn extra money in cash. Then we wore false beards to pretend to be the musicians whom people were familiar with. In addition, we attached humorous acts to our performances and played jokes on each other. Soon, our “funny jazz” became famous and invitations to perform for broadcast stations began to come. Afterwards, we sorted out attractive music and made a record in a studio. A million or so copies were sold and we became millionaires.

　　It was painful that the band broke up finally. But above all, I realized my dream to be a musician.

　我对音乐很敏感，只要简要地浏览一下乐谱，我就能演唱或演奏得很好。说实话，我一直都梦想着能成为出名的民间演员，自信的我从未减少过热爱。

　我组成的第一支乐队叫做“摇滚蛙”。开始，我们依靠在酒吧里或向路人表演乐器来挣些零花的现金。然后我们带上假胡子假扮人们熟悉的音乐家，除此之外，我们在表演中加上幽默的动作，互相开着玩笑。很快，我们的“滑稽爵士乐”出了名，到广播电台表演的邀请开始多起来。随后，我们把我们吸引人的音乐做了分类，在一间音乐工作室录制了1张唱片，大约卖出了100万张，这使我们都成了百万富翁

乐队最终的解散让我很心痛，但最重要的是，我实现了自己当音乐家的梦想。

 

 

 

## 11、An Interesting Festival（有趣的节日）

　　The Agricultural Feast takes place after the Independence Day. It is not a worldwide celebration. Only Christians in Mexico look forward to its arrival for its religious origin:

　Long ago, humans’ ancestors were bad. They fooled and played tricks on each other and never kept their word. So God turned up and drowned all their crops. Humans starved day and night, weeping. In order to gain God’s forgiveness, a woman poet set off to see God. She admired God and kept apologizing. God was moved. With his permission, humans finally had good harvests again. So, to wipe sadness and remind themselves of the belief in God, people began the festival.

　On the festival, people gather in open air, such as playgrounds or parking lots, and energetically have fun with each other all night long, as though they were never tired. When a beauty dressed up in lovely clothing reads poems in memory of the poet, everyone holds their breath. Then, it is the custom that the bone of a rooster head is given to her as an award.

　　Obviously, the story is not true, but the festival is interesting.

　农业盛会在独立日后举行。它不是一个世界性的庆典，由于它的宗教起源，只有墨西哥的基督徒才盼着节日的到来：

　很久以前，人类的祖先很坏，他们互相欺骗，耍诡计，从不遵守诺言。于是，上帝出现了，淹死了他们所有的作物。人们日夜挨饿，哭泣着。为了获得上帝的原谅，一位女诗人出发去见上帝。她对上帝的赞美和怀有的歉意感动了上帝，有了他的允许，人类终于又获得了丰收。因此，为了抹去忧伤并提醒自己对上帝的信仰，人们开始举办这个节日。

在节日那天，人们聚集在露天场所，例如操场或停车场，通宵达旦地玩得非常开心，精力充沛的人们似乎不知疲倦。当一位用可爱的衣服盛装打扮的美女朗读诗歌以纪念那位诗人时，在场的每个人都屏住了呼吸，然后，按照风俗，将奖励给她一只公鸡的头骨。

　　很明显，这个故事不是真的，但是节日却很有趣。

 

 

## 12、Balanced Diet（平衡膳食）

　　Wang Peng earned his living by running a barbecue restaurant, which served delicious bacon, fried chicken breast and mutton roasted with pepper and garlic. But his food and discount attracted fewer and fewer customers. Finally, he was in debt. Yong Hui’s slimming restaurant served fresh peas, carrots, eggplants, and raw cucumbers with vinegar. As the hostess, she said fibres benefited customers' digestion the most. In order not to let Yong Hui get away with telling

lies, Wang Peng spied on Yong Hui despite her glare. But he was surprised that she was losing her customers, too.

Curiosity drove Wang Peng to consult an expert. The expert sighed and said, “Both of your menus have weakness and limited strength. Your customers put on weight too easily, while Yong Hui’s lose weight too quickly. So, Wang Peng, cut down the fat of your food and increase vegetables and fruits, like nuts, beans, mushrooms, peaches and lemons. You ought to combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet.”

Before long, Wang Peng won his customers back.

　王鹏经营一家烧烤餐厅来谋生，他的餐厅供应美味的腊肉、油炸的鸡胸，还有用辣椒和大蒜一起烤制的羊肉。但是，他的食物和折扣吸引的顾客越来越少，最后是他负债累累。永慧的减肥餐厅供应的是新鲜的豌豆、红萝卜、茄子和醋腌的生黄瓜。作为老板娘(女主人)，她总是说食物纤维才最有利于顾客的消化。为了不让永慧说了谎不受惩罚，王鹏不顾她的怒视，前去探查个究竟。但是让他惊奇的是，永慧的顾客也在严重地流失。

好奇心驱使王鹏去咨询专家。那位专家叹息着说：“你们俩的菜单都缺点明显、优点有限。你的顾客很容易就发胖，而永慧的顾客体重却减轻得太快。所以嘛，王鹏，你要减少你的食物中的脂肪含量，增加蔬菜和水果，例如坚果、豆类、蘑菇、桃子和柠檬之类。你应该把两份菜单结合起来，给顾客提供平衡的膳食。”

　　不久，王鹏就赢回了他的顾客。

## 13、Sailing Home（划船回家）

　　This novel was about an unbelievable but genuine adventure. Its author was a black businessman who was brought up in America. In 1956, he visited Africa, his birthplace. One day, when he was wandering on the pavement near the bay enjoying the sea scenes, he lost his money and passport that he kept in an envelope. So he went to the embassy to seek help, but the ambassador with rude manners didn’t permit his staff to help though he bowed to him. Staring at his impatient face, he understood that it was the fault of his skin colour that accounted for their refection. So he decided to take a chance to sail on a small boat home.

　　He met a large amount of difficulty but was never stopped. On the contrary, difficulty pushed him to go ahead harder. Three months later, he was spotted by a ship by accident. He was in rags indeed. A maid even screamed when bringing him a steak and pineapple dessert. Aboard, he earned his passage by working as a barber and got home finally. As for the name of his novel, he couldn’t think of a better one than the phrase “Go Ahead”.

　　这部小说写的是一次令人难以置信而又真实的历险。其作者是一位在美国被抚养长大的黑人商人。1956年，他回到他的出生地非洲。有一天，当他在海湾边的人行道上漫步欣赏海景时，他丢失了一个装着钱和护照的信封，于是向当地的大使馆寻求帮助。但是大使态度非常粗鲁，即使向他鞠躬，也不允许他的职员帮忙。盯着他那不耐烦的脸，他知道是他皮肤颜色的错才导致了他们的拒绝。于是，他决定冒险驾驶一只小船回家。

　　他遇到了许多困难，但是从未停止，相反，困难推动他更努力地前进。三个月后，当他被一艘船偶然发现时，真的是衣衫褴褛。给他端来牛排和菠萝甜品的女仆甚至被吓得尖叫起来。在船上，他当一名理发师来挣取船费，最后终于回到了家。至于这部小说的名字，他再也不能想到一个比“前进”更好的短语了。

 

 

## 14、Explore MKII（探测MKII行星）

　　MKII, a planet billions of kilometers away, is the origin of life in many religions. Physicists have proved the theory that its gentle climate and the pull of its gravity are similar to the earth’s. And astronomers have found that oxygen atoms and carbon dioxide, which are fundamental to life, exist in its atmosphere through satellites. Cheered up by this news, biologists, in their turn, began to do some research to remove people’s puzzles—Now that there are some suitable conditions, does life really exist on this globe? Do they multiply by laying eggs or giving birth to babies?

　　Last month, a spaceship was sent there. It’s a pity that this mission failed. Unlike the earth, MKII is a much younger planet. Thus, masses of harmful acid clouds float everywhere causing violent chain reactions to break out. These clouds not only blocked outthe pilots’ sight but also damaged the engine system. Luckily, the pilots watched out carefully and prevented the spaceship from crashing in time.

MK二号是一颗几十亿公里外的行星，它在许多宗教里都是生命起源的地方。物理学家已经证明了它温和的气候和重力的牵引都和地球相似的理论;天文学家也通过卫星，在它的大气层里发现了氧原子和二氧化碳的存在，这些都是对生命来说，都是基本的。受到这一消息的鼓舞，生物学家们接着开始了研究以解开人们的迷惑——既然有了适合的条件，生命真的存在于这个星球吗?他们是通过下蛋，还是产仔来繁殖后代的呢?

　上个月，一艘太空飞船被派到了那儿。可惜的是，这次任务失败了。不像地球，MK二号是一颗年轻得多的行星。因此，大团大团的有害酸云到处漂浮，引起猛烈的连锁反应的爆发。这些云团不仅阻挡了飞行员的视线，而且还损坏了发动机系统。幸运的是，飞行员小心注意，才及时阻止了飞船的坠毁。

 

 

 

## 15、A Journey across Canada（横穿加拿大的旅行）

　　After a quiz last autumn, Kuang crossed the continent eastward to Toronto to visit his schoolmate, the distance measuring approximately 5,000 kilometers,　　His train started from Vancouver, a city surrounded by mountains. After confirming his baggage was aboard the train, Kuang settled down in his seat. Having a gift for communication, he started chatting with another passenger within 5 minutes. Their topics included the Canadian traditions, the Prime Minister, the mixture of races, and the terrifying Great Fall. After a nice buffet at noon, he was pleased to find that the scenery was impressive. He saw beautiful harbours in the distance, wealthy urban areas and maple forest that covered thousands of acres. He even managed to catch sight of an eagle flying upward over bushes.

Kuang reached Toronto which lies slightly near the border at a misty dawn. There was frost and the broad downtown streets were very quiet. Though it was early, Kuang phoned his schoolmate in a booth nearby at once rather than waiting for him to come. They had a good time together.

　去年秋天的一次考试后，光向东横穿整个大陆，来到多伦多探望他的同学，这次旅行的距离测量起来大约有五千多公里。

　他的火车从群山围绕的温哥华启程。在证实了自己的行李都在火车上之后，光就在座位上安坐下来。因为在与人交流方面有天赋，他在5分钟内就和另一个乘客聊起天来。他们的话题包括加拿大的传统、加拿大的总理、种族的混合，还有让人心惊胆战的大瀑布。中午吃了一顿美味的自助餐后，他很高兴发现外面的风景非常让人印象深刻。他看见了远处美丽的海港、富裕的市区，还有延绵几千亩的枫树林，他甚至还设法看见了一只在灌木丛上空翱翔的鹰。　　光在一个薄雾笼罩的黎明到达稍稍接近边境的多伦多，地上有霜，宽阔的市区街道很安静。尽管还很早，光却不愿等待，立刻就在附近电话亭给同学打了个电话。他们在一起度过了美好的时光。

## 17、A New Farming Way（新的耕种方式）

　　Tuan was a farmer in Vietnam. For decades, he had been struggling to rid his family of hunger. However, it always confused him how to expand the output of his crops. This disturbing problem led to his regretting being a farmer. He would rather have chosen another job.

　One day, when skimming through a newspaper, Tuan read a comment on Yuan Longpin. He underlined Yuan’s nationality and occupation, and then focused on his discovery and the statistics of his research. He found the knowledge Yuan circulated very practical. Therefore, he made a summary and began to build up a new farming method. He planted super grain of rich nutrition and equipped himself to keep his crops roots free from bacteria and pests. He also enriched minerals in the soil while reducing chemical fertilizers. Though it cost him more time and freedom, he was full of hope.

　The next year, Tuan was sunburnt but satisfied with his production very much. Thanks to Yuan Longpin, he not only won the battle against hunger, but he could also export his crops abroad.

　　俊是一名越南的农民，几十年来，他都一直在努力使家人摆脱饥饿。然而，如何扩大他的农作物产量这一问题却一直在困扰着他。这个恼人的问题导致了他后悔当一名农民，而宁愿自己当初选择其它的工作。

　一天，俊在浏览报纸的时候，读到一篇关于袁隆平的评论。他在袁的国籍和职业下面划了线，然后将焦点集中在他的发现和研究数据上。他发现袁传播的知识非常实用，因此，他做了摘要，并开始建立一种新的耕作方式。他种植营养丰富的超级谷物，添置设备以使作物的根部免受细菌害虫的伤害;他还增加土壤所含的矿物质，同时减少化学肥料的使用。尽管耗费了他更多的时间和自由，他却充满着希望。

　第二年，俊被晒黑了，但是却对自己的生产非常满意。多亏了袁隆平，他不仅赢得了对抗饥饿的战斗，而且还将自己的作物出口到国外呢。

 

 

## 18、Chaplin - A Great Master of Humour（幽默大师卓别林）

　　Chaplin was an extraordinary performer who starred in and directed many outstanding comedies. Few were bored watching his moustache, his gestures or his entertaining reactions when chased by detectives. Being drunk, sliding on a banana skin or whispering his own failures to nobody, he made us feel more content with our life without any verbal explanation. His particular sense of humor has astonished everybody throughout the world up to now.

　In a small budget film, he played a badly-off and homeless person wearing worn-out shoes and messy clothes. On one occasion, he was trapped by a snowstorm in a vast mountainous area. Though he overcame many difficulties, he wasn’t fortunate enough. With all the porridge eaten up, he picked out a shoe and boiled it to eat. He cut off the leather bottom and chewed it like a pancake. According to an actress, his acting was so convincing and amusing that everybody couldn’t help bursting into laughter.

　卓别林是一名非凡的演员，他主演并导演了多部杰出的喜剧。看见他可笑的小胡子、滑稽的手势动作，还有面对警探的追捕时有趣的反应，很少有人会觉得厌烦。喝醉酒啦，踩到香蕉皮滑倒啦，或者自言自语(低语)自己的糗事啦，他无需任何语言解释的表演总是使我们对自己的生活感到更加满意。他独特的幽默感直到现在依然使世界各地的人们都感到惊讶。

　在一部小预算的电影里，他穿着磨破的鞋子和脏兮兮的衣服，扮演了一名贫穷又无家可归的人。在一幕场景中，他被一场暴风雪困在一片多山的区里。尽管他克服了许多困难，但是他还是运气不好的。粥都吃完了，他只好挑出一只鞋子煮来吃。他切下皮革的鞋底，像烙饼一样地咀嚼起来。据一名女演员所说，他的表演是如此地令人信服而又逗人发笑的，以致在场的所有人都忍不住大笑起来。

 

 

 

## 19、A Misunderstanding（一场误会）

　　In general, spoken statements are the major way of communication, but body language and facial expressions also have such kinds of function. For example, yawning means being not interested and turning one’s back to someone or swinging your fist shows your anger. But what those gestures really mean is subjective in different cultures. Thus, misunderstandings happen now and then in today’s world of cultural crossroads.

　　Once, representing the Adults’ Education Association, I went to the airport to meet an official of high rank from Columbia and take him to his dormitory and then to the canteen. After the flight arrived, I saw a man looking around curiously. So I approached to greet him. He suddenly dashed to hug me and kissed me on both cheeks. As a young girl, I felt truly embarrassed and put up my hands to defend myself. His false smile told me that he had lost face.

Later, I received a cassette from him, in which he recorded his apology. On hearing that Columbians were more likely to kiss others, I soon felt at ease.

　通常说来，口头表达是人们交流的主要方法，但是肢体语言和面部表情也有这种功能。例如，打哈欠意味着不感兴趣，背对别人或向其挥舞拳头表达的是愤怒。但是在不同的文化中那些手势表达的真正意思是很主观的。由此，误会就时不时地发生在今天这个文化交叉碰撞的世界里。

　有一回，我代表成人教育协会到机场去接一位从哥伦比亚来的高级官员，我得带他到宿舍和食堂。当他的航班到达时，我看见一名男子好奇地东张西望，于是走上前去和他打招呼。他突然猛冲过来拥抱我，还亲了我的脸颊。还是个年轻姑娘的我感到真尴尬，不由自主举起手来保护自己。他的假笑告诉我他感到丢了面子。、

后来，我收到他送来的一盒磁带，里面录了他的道歉。当听到这只是因为哥伦比亚人更倾向于见面时互相亲吻时，我很快就感到轻松安心了。

 

 

 

## 20、A Unique Theme Park（独一无二的主题公园）

　　As soon as our shuttle got close to the theme park by the freeway, everyone came to life and put on cloth sneakers in advance for an outing. Our translator paid for the admission, and we started enjoying the various attractions in the sunlight.

　According to the travel brochure, this unique park is famous for its well preserved minority culture. We experienced many deeds of the early settlers, such as swinging across rivers, hunting creatures in the jungle, or taking part in swords fighting tournaments.

　This park is also famous for its wooden souvenirs. Whichever we bought in the central shop was made of wood, and wherever we went we could see minority carpenters working. They made wooden tools, wooden cartoon figures, wooden athletic products and so on. They even built a huge wooden engine with a length of 20 metres, which was modeled after a real one.

　This theme park is really a fantasy amusement park. No wonder it has become the brand of local tourism.

　我们走高速公路的来往穿梭巴士一接近主题公园，大家都活跃了起来，并且提前穿上了布鞋，做好这趟外出旅游的准备。翻译付了入场费后，我们就开始在阳光下欣赏各种各样吸引人的东西。

　根据旅行手册的介绍，这个独一无二的公园因其得到良好保护的少数名族文化而闻名。我们体验了许多早期定居者所做的事，如荡过河啦，在丛林中猎杀动物啦，或者参加剑术比赛啦等等。

　　这个公园还因为它的木制纪念品而闻名，我们在中心商场购买的任何一件物品，都是用木头制作的，无论我们走到哪里，都可以看见少数名族的木匠们在忙碌。他们制作的有木制工具、木制的卡通人物、木制的运动用的产品，等等等等。他们甚至还根据一台真实发动机仿造了一台长度有20米的木制发动机。

这个主题公园真是个充满幻想的娱乐公园，怪不得它成为当地旅游业的一个品牌。

 

 

 

 

## 21、A Strange Disease（奇怪的疾病）

　　When the construction of the firework factory came to the stage of painting, a pump was put in. Then, all the painters in the neighbourhood were defeated by a severe disease whose characteristic was alike to that of a bad burn.

　An expert physician was instructed to attend to the victims and handle this case. He was enthusiastic, but he didn’t foresee that it was a hard challenge. After simple enquiry, he announced that the polluted paint was to blame. But without positive evidence, people suspected and rejected his view, saying the theory he put forward made no sense. Being much more strict with himself, he contributed himself to the case. Apart from making enquiries, he made detailed charts and analysed the data cautiously. Finally, he drew a scientific conclusion, linking the disease tothe radium in the pump. Exposed to radium, a kind of radioactive material in the universe, people absorbed radiation and got sick immediately.

 Spinning the pump backward, he took away the radium. This simple movement cured all the victims.

当那座烟花工厂的建设到了油漆阶段时，一个水泵被安装进来，接着，在它附近的油漆工都得了一种严重的疾病(疾病击败油漆工)，其特征与烧伤相似。

　一位经验丰富的内科医生被指定去照顾受害者并负责处理这一案例。他热情地投入到工作中，但是却没有预见到这是一次艰难的挑战。在简单的询问后，他就宣布说罪魁祸首是受污染的油漆(油漆应受责备)。但是没有确实的证据，人们很怀疑并拒绝他的观点，大家都说他提出的理论毫无道理。他对自己要求更加严格，全身心地投入。除了询问，他还制作了详细的图表，谨慎地分析各项数据，最后，他终于得出了一个科学的结论，把疾病和水泵中的镭联系起来。镭是宇宙中的一种放射性物质，当暴露在镭的辐射中时，人体吸收其射线，立刻染上疾病。

　　他把水泵向后旋转，拿走了里面的镭，这个简单的动作治愈了所有的受害者。

 

 

 

 

 

## 22、Sightseeing in the United Kingdom（观光联合王国）

　　After the wedding, my cousin and his wife went to the United Kingdom for nationwide sightseeing. He faxed a letter to me in English yesterday. To my delight, he no longer made any tense error. And his description roughly clarified my questions about the UK--its currency, its administration, the institution which divides it into four provinces, and the historical conflicts and quarrels when Southern Ireland broke away from the UK.

　Unwilling to leave out any attraction, my cousin arranged his enjoyable journey carefully. One attractive place he visited was a castle in the countryside of Scotland, which lies near a port. It used to be the headquarters(请注意：音频里面是headquarter，没有加s，是不对的。)of the Communism Union but broke down during the war. Finding nothing could take the place of this splendid architecture, people accomplished rebuilding it in 1952. It was to their credit that all furnished rooms are consistent with what they used to be. My cousin was thrilled by its collections consisting of statues plus royal uniforms folded in glass tanks. Though there was no possibility to buy some of these exhibits, it was convenient to take photos, which he sent me along with his fax.

　我的表弟和他妻子在举办了婚礼后到联合王国做全国旅游观光去了。他昨天传真了一封英文信给我，让我高兴的是，他再也不犯时态错误了，而且他的描述也粗略地向我阐明了关于英国的一些问题——它的货币啦，行政管理啦，把它分成四个行政区的制度啦，还有在南爱尔兰脱离联合王国时发生的一些历史上的冲突和争拗。

　　因为不愿意漏掉任何一个景点，我表弟仔细地安排了他愉快的旅程。他参观的其中一个吸引人的地方是苏格兰乡村的一个城堡。城堡靠近一座港口，曾经是共产主义联盟会的总部，但是在战争中倒塌了。人们发现没有任何东西可以取代这座辉煌的建筑，于是在1952年完成了重建。值得赞扬的是，所有配备家具的房间都和它们过去一致的。由雕像加折叠在玻璃柜里的皇家制服组成的收藏品使我表弟震撼不已。尽管没有可能购买这些展览品，拍照却很方便，他在传真中一起发给了我。

 

## 23、An Air Crash（飞机失事）

　　I was a previous typist in a post office. Because I couldn’t tolerate typing any more postage bills or postcodes on a typewriter every day, I resigned. With a greedy motivation of making big money, I took up working as a business representative for the G.E Ecology Company, which produced goods by recycling useful materials from our dustbins. My new job left me good impressions in many aspects except that the working timetable was full of traveling by jets.

　Once, when speeding up, our jet was swallowed by a thunderstorm, which destroyed our GPS receiver and made us lose sight of the directions. A constantly flashing light showed that our jet was in danger. A steward instantly asked us to put on masks and fasten the safety belts, and then pressed a button to switch on the escaping capsule. It slid sideways out of the opening at once and landed in a desert area safely. Lacking food and tablets, we were nervous and uncertain at first. But we all kept optimistic and made good adjustment to the situation. We swept up the surrounding mud to make our settlement and were back on our feet soon. Finally, guided by the smoke of our crashing jet, some local citizens came by carriages and saved us.

　我以前是一家邮局的打字员，因为忍受够了每天在打字机上打邮资账单或邮政编码，我辞了职。带着想挣大钱的贪婪动机，我开始给一家叫G.E生态公司的企业当商务代表，这家公司通过回收我们垃圾箱里的有用材料生产商品。我的新工作在多方面都给了我很好的印象，除了一点：乘飞机旅行挤满了我的工作时间表。

　有一次，我们的喷气飞机在加速时被一场雷暴吞没，不仅损坏了GPS信号接收器，还使我们看不见方向。一盏持续闪亮的灯说明我们的飞机正处在危险中。一名乘务员立刻让我们戴上面罩、系牢安全带，接着按下一枚按钮 打开逃生仓电源，逃生仓马上侧着滑出出口，安全降落在一片荒凉的地区。因为缺少食品和药品，我们一开始都又紧张又心里没底，但是我们都保持乐观，做好调整适应这一新境况。我们打扫干净周围的泥土，安顿下来，很快就恢复过来。最后，在我们坠机烟雾的指引下，一些当地的居民搭乘马车到来，我们都获救了。

 

 

 

## 24、An Amateur Journalist（业余记者）

　　Jane is a housewife, but delighted to work as an amateur journalist. It is a dilemma for her to rush between family and work, and it is also unusual for the News Department to depend on an amateur to cover crimes. But Jane is really gifted. It is admirable that she is seldom accused of making mistakes. And, eager to become more professional, she concentrates on her job and updates herself now and then.

　Once she is informed of a new case, her normal working process is as follows: first, she makes appointments with guilty people for interviews. So as to acquire accurate stories, she usually demands to record what they say. Meanwhile, a technically good colleague will assist her in taking photographs. Second, she assesses whether they are deliberately hiding the truth. If she is skeptical about their words, she will look into the case herself. Third, she writes thorough stories ahead of the deadline and submits it to the senior chief editor, who polishes and approves every section. Finally, her stories will be published in different editions of their magazine.

 

 

简是一名家庭主妇，但却非常乐意做一名业余记者。在家和工作之间奔波总是使她左右为难，而且对于新闻部来说，依靠一名业余人员来报道罪案也是不同寻常的，但是简真的很有天赋，让人钦佩的是她极少因为犯错而受到责备。因为渴望做得更加专业，她全神贯注于工作，且时不时地就提升自身的业务水平。

一旦接到新案子的通知，她通常的工作程序如下：首先，她和有罪的人约了作采访。为了获得准确的新闻，她通常要求做录音，同时，一位技术上好的同事会协助她拍照;接着，她对受采访的人是否有故意隐瞒真相作出评估。如果她怀疑他们的话，就会亲自调查案件;然后，她在截稿期限前写出详尽的报道，呈交给高级主编，由他对每个部分做润色和批准;最后，她的新闻就发表在杂志的各个版本中了。

 

 

## 25、First Aid（急救）

　　A boy fell ill. His organs were damaged by the radiation of an infrared ray stove. But before the ambulance arrived, a number of other injuries happened to this unlucky boy over and over again. First, he was choked by some poisonous liquid from the kettle on the cupboard. Then his wrist skin was burnt by electric shock. Finally, his ankle was cut by a pan.

　Fortunately, the boy’s nurse gave him proper temporary treatments according to his complex symptoms. She mildly squeezed the poisonous liquid out of his throat and put bandages firmly in place to apply pressure to the ankle wound to stop bleeding. As for the burn, she used scissors to remove his sleeve, poured a basin of cold water over the burn to cool it and put her hands on a damp blouse to cover his swollen tissue tightly. She also inspired his bravery to fight against the unbearable pain. Her first aid made a vital difference in saving his life. A ceremony was held to honour the nurse who overcame a variety of barriers to save the boy.

有个孩子病倒了，他的体内器官被一台红外线烤炉的放射线灼伤了。但是在救护车到来前，这个不幸的孩子身上还一而再、再而三地发生了许多别的伤害。开始是被橱柜上水壶里的有毒液体噎住，然后是手腕的皮肤被电击烧伤，最后，一只平底锅还割伤了他的脚踝。

幸运的是，男孩的保姆根据他的复杂症状给予了适当的临时治疗。她轻轻地从他喉咙里把有毒液体挤了出来;并在脚踝合适的位置紧紧扎上绷带，施加压力使伤口的流血止住;对于烧伤，她用剪刀剪去他的袖子，倒了一盆凉水给烧伤位置降温，并找来一件湿的女式衬衫紧紧盖住他肿胀的皮肤组织。此外，她还激发起他的勇敢和难以忍受的疼痛做斗争。她的急救在挽救他性命中起了至关重要的作用。人们举办了一场典礼来表彰这位克服各种障碍挽救了男孩的小保姆。

 

 

 

 

## 26、Abstract Art（抽象艺术）

　　Abstract art used to be controversial. On one hand, the artists stopped painting delicate figures but attempted to adopt special techniques to give people different visual impacts. On the other hand, their works, including sculptures carved out of marble or fragile clay, were all with a specific aim of showing feelings. Some conventional scholars who were allergic to abstract art said it was evidently ridiculous and neither art nor geometry. Their Traditional Art Committee predicted its soon disappearing.

But nowadays, abstract art has become part of the permanent possessions of contemporary civilization. Galleries along the Madison Avenue give scores of superb exhibitions on typical abstract works, appealing to many who have a preference for abstract art. The Shadow of Egypt, a café in this district, has become the home to those aggressive abstract artists. Consequently, it is not a coincidence for you to meet one of these artists of great reputation in the flesh. They are asked for signatures and given bunches of fragrant flowers plus they are given a great deal of praise by their faithful fans.

抽象艺术曾经颇受争议，一方面，抽象艺术家们不再画精致的画像，而是试图采用特别的技巧给人们以不同的视觉冲击;另一方面，他们的作品，包括用大理石和易碎的粘土雕刻出来的雕像，都以表达感情为其明确的目的。有些对抽象艺术反感的传统学者说抽象艺术是极其明显地荒谬可笑，说它既不是艺术，又不是几何学，他们的传统艺术委员会还预言了它的迅速消失。

　但是到了今天，抽象艺术已经成为当代文明永久财产的一部分，麦蒂逊大道的画廊为典型的抽象艺术作品举办了许多出色的展览，吸引了许多对抽象艺术有偏爱的人。这区有家叫埃及之影的咖啡馆已经成为那些有进取精神的抽象艺术家们活动的根据地，所以，亲眼见到一位名声极大的艺术家本人并不是什么巧合的事，他们被忠实的崇拜者索取签名，并被给予成束的芬芳花朵和大量的赞扬。

 

 

## 27、A Russian Poem（俄国童谣）

Since childhood, Anton had often recited poems, accompanied by pianists and violinists, at wedding ceremonies before brides and bridegrooms exchanged rings. Gradually, he found writing poems the most appropriate way to convey his joy and sorrow. When his poem Contradictory Blank won him a national championship and a scholarship to the Moscow University from a sponsor, he was just an unknown librarian. After getting his diploma, he devoted his life to writing poems. Using concrete but flexible language and the minimum of words is his style. He tried out different patterns and preferred nursery rhyme in particular. The following is a translation of one of his works made up of 3 sections

Little sparrow with heavy load, Ran out of energy and very cold; No compass and all sweat salty, Can you go through the endless darkness? Little balloon let out by the thread, Flew over cottages and was very glad; With warmth transformed from sunlight, He said he could forever fly; Take it easy, little balloon; Don’t tease the sparrow with his wound; On the bare branch and have a rest; This diamond heart will eventually get success.

从童年时起，安东就常常在钢琴师或小提琴师的伴奏下在婚礼上朗诵诗歌，为新郎新娘交换戒指前的仪式助兴。渐渐地，他发现写诗是表达他的欢乐和悲伤的最合适方式。在他还是个寂寞无闻的图书管理员时，他的诗《矛盾的空白》就获得了全国诗歌创作冠军，并为他赢得一位赞助人提供的奖学金，到莫斯科大学深造。获得文凭后，他将一生都投入到诗歌创作中。使用具体而灵活的语言和最少的词语数量是他的风格，他还喜欢尝试不同的诗歌形式，特别是童谣。下面由三部分组成的译文就是他的作品中的一首：

小麻雀，负重担，  筋疲力尽挡风寒，  

汗水成盐无指引，  能否穿越无边暗？

小气球，脱绳系，  飞越农舍真高兴，

阳光给予它温暖，  永远高飞不费力；

别紧张，小气球，  别笑麻雀伤口留，

光光的树梢歇片刻， 恒（钻石）心终把成功求。

 

 

## 28、Let’s Help Adolescents（帮助青少年）

　　Whether they are male or female, adolescents feel like deciding on everything themselves in spite of parents’ instruction, especially when they face problems like sex, mental stress, etc., which make them feel ashamed and embarrassed. Thus they often automatically get into troubles due to their imperfect comprehension and judgement. Some are addicted to cigarettes, only several packets of which will hurt their lungs and make them breathless quickly. Others can’t quit drinking alcohol, whose harmful effects include causing young pregnant women to abort or give birth to abnormal babies. The worst is drug abuse, for the withdrawal is tough once their bodies are accustomed to the drugs. Meanwhile, those who share needles bought from illegal chemists are at great risk of being infected with desperate AIDS. If so, neither injecting nor taking pills can guarantee their survival.

　　However, don’t be disappointed at or have prejudice against our children so easily. After all, being awkward is an appendix of youth. As long as we strengthen communication with them instead of only banning this or banning that, we will surely help them avoid anything unfit.

　不论男女，青少年们都喜欢不顾家长的指导，自己对一切作决定，特别是当他们面对如性、心理压力等等一些使他们觉得羞愧和尴尬的问题时更是如此。因此，由于他们理解力和判断力的不足，他们常常会无意识地陷入困境中。有的对香烟上瘾，只要几包就会对他们的肺造成损害，使他们很容易就气喘吁吁;有的没法戒除酒精带来的不良后果，包括造成年轻的怀孕女性流产或生下不正常的婴儿;最糟糕的是滥用毒品，因为一旦他们的身体对毒品习惯了，要想戒毒就相当困难了。同时，那些共用从非法药剂师处购买的注射器的青少年冒着感染令人绝望的艾滋病的极大风险，一旦感染上，不管是打针还是吃药都没法保证他们的生存了。

　然而，请不要轻易就对我们的孩子失望或抱有偏见，毕竟，不成熟是年轻的必然附属品。只要我们加强和他们的沟通，而不是仅仅禁止这样，不准那样，我们一定能帮助他们避开不健康的东西。

 

## 29、Refresh Our Environment（恢复环境生机）

　　As the director stated on behalf of his researching group, the data of this graph makes a clear presentation of the future environmental tendency. On one hand, the quantity of fuel keeps on decreasing by 9% per year while the growth of a wide range of pollution has been a global trend. On the other hand, the mildly but steadily going up of the average temperature is resulting in catastrophes like widespread floods. Without disagreement, they subscribe to the view that it is humans’ existence and their randomly consuming energy that result in this phenomenon.

　Many people have a commitment that developing nuclear power or energy from outer space will stop bad consequences coming about. However, scientists and educators are opposed to this view even if our needs may be met on the whole. They tend to advocate refreshing our circumstances by saving energy and recycling waste. It is suggested that we use energy-saving appliances such as electrical motors, microwaves and so on and not be casual about little things like recycling a can. So please glance around and see what you can do. So long as everybody makes contribution, we will not have to put up with this problem anymore.

　正如那位主任代表他的研究小组所说明的那样，这张图表的数据清楚地描述了未来环境的趋势：一方面，燃料的数量以每年9%的速度持续减少，同时，大范围污染的增长已经成为一种全球趋势;另一反面，平均气温轻微却稳定地升高正在造成像广泛的洪涝那样的灾难。无不同意地，他们一致赞成是人类的存在和任意的消耗能源才造成了这一现象。

　许多人都信奉开发核能和外太空能源会防止糟糕的后果发生的理论，然而，即使这样可以基本上满足我们的需要，科学家和教育家们仍然反对这一观点。他们更倾向于拥护用节省能源和回收废料的方法恢复环境生机，并建议我们要使用节省能源的器具，如电力发动机、微波炉等，还建议我们不要对如回收罐子这种小事漫不经心。因此，看看你身边是否有你能做的事，只要每个人都作出贡献，我们就不必再忍受这个问题的困扰了。

 

 

## 30、A Volcano Eruption（火山爆发）

　　As the best candidate, I was appointed to collect and evaluate information for a database about diverse natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or thunderstorms. Sometimes I did this by giving out questionnaires to those who went through them. But sometimes I had to go through actual disasters myself. The Musaki Volcano was one of them.

　　At that time, I lived in a bungalow alongside the volcano with a novelist, who came for the appreciation of its eruption. One day, when I was drawing diagrams on the balcony and he was bathing inside, the volcano erupted unexpectedly. The ash and lava fountains shooting highly in the sky varied from 50 to 100 meters in height. It was absolutely fantastic! I even noticed a rainbow appear in the fog caused by a heat wave.

　But, glancing through our surroundings, I foresaw the potential danger and found no guarantee of our safety. The uncomfortable gas almost made us unconscious. Sweats of anxiety began to drop. Managing to stop panicking and trembling, we quickly put on our protective suits, helmets and boots and eventually made our way to a safe place. How lucky we were even though my precious equipment and documents were all burnt to the ground!

　作为最好的候选人，我被委派为一个数据库收集和评估各种自然灾害的信息，例如飓风、台风或雷暴等。有时我通过向经历过这些灾害的人分发调查问卷来收集信息，有时却得亲自经历实际的灾害。Musaki火山就是其中之一。

那时，我和一名来欣赏火山爆发的小说家同住在火山边上的一座平房里。有一天，当我正在阳台上画图表而他在屋里洗澡时，火山突然爆发了，喷射到天空中的火山灰和岩浆喷泉从50米到100米不等，这一情景绝对地奇异，我甚至还注意到一条彩虹出现在热浪造成的雾里。

然而，我向四周看了一下，马上预见到了潜在的危险，也发现了我们的安全毫无保障。令人不舒服的气体几乎使我们失去知觉，忧虑的汗水开始流淌下来。我们努力使自己不要惊慌和颤抖，迅速穿上保护套装、头盔和靴子，最后成功前往安全的地方。尽管我珍贵的设备和文件都烧得精光，但是我们真的非常幸运。

 

 

## 31、Defeat Disability（战胜残疾）

　　Yang’s ambition was to get an architect certificate or become a bowling master. But when he was conducting experiments with a microscope in the basement, a tank on the bench exploded, sending him flying outwards through the exit. He was out of breath while knowing he lost his eyesight as well as 70% of his hearing. In other words, he was disabled.

　Feeling clumsy, he was annoyed at first though nobody made fun of him. He cut out going outdoors and just sat around at home talking to his parrot or tortoise silently. His sister resigned to help him in many ways. Her assistance and encouragement were so beneficial to his psychology that he adapted to his disability soon and became outgoing again. In a college accessible to him, he studied politics and literature. He always sat in the front row near the entry without any absence and, with the help of his handy laptop, he studied well by means of dictation. His thesis, Abolishing Slavery, met with all professors’ approval. After class, he and his companions often played drum music, which was noisy but suitable for his hearing. After graduation, he made high profits by designing software for a firm. All in all, in his community, he won his dignity and people’s congratulations.

　He always wished all the best to his disabled fellows and encouraged them, “Never mind! All you have is adequate to get your achievement.”

　阳的雄心是，要么获得一张建筑师证书，要么成为一名保龄球高手。但是在地下室里的显微镜下进行试验时，放在长凳上的一只大桶突然爆炸，把他从出口处炸飞了出去。当知道自己除了失去70%的听力之外，还失去了视力时，他完全喘不过气来。换句话说，他残疾了。

最初，尽管没人取笑他，他还是非常气恼于自己的笨拙。他取消了外出，总是在家里闲坐，和他的鹦鹉和乌龟默默相对。他的姐姐辞了职，用许多方式帮助他。她的帮助和鼓励对他的心理是如此地有益，以致他很快就适应了自己的残疾，再次变得外向起来。他在一所接受他就读的学校里学习政治和文学，总是坐在靠近入口的前排，从不缺席。在他轻便好用的手提电脑的帮助下，他用听写的方式学习得很好。他的论文《废除奴隶制》受到所有教授的一致认可。课后，他和伙伴们还常常演奏大声却适合他听觉的鼓乐。毕业后，他通过设计软件为一家公司获得很高的利润。总之，在他的社区里，他赢得了自己的尊严和人们的祝贺。

　他一直都把所有最好祝愿给予他残疾的同伴，并鼓励他们：“没关系，你拥有的一切一定足够你取得自己的成就!”

 

 

## 32、Happy Marriage Needs Fighting For（幸福的婚姻需要争取）

　　As a talented navy officer, he was bound to be busy. When his wife rang him up to declare her divorce alarm, he was still scanning a digital counter to check the data so as to give an assessment of the theoretical framework for a biochemical weapon. His junior staff’s sympathy made him feel embarrassed.　His wife was a part-time clerk. With his high bonus, she lived in a grand house with elegant cushions and bedding. Her favour was reading stars’ biographies or absurd fictions with endless chapters in her armchair. People envied her leisure life very much. But in fact, she was tired of being left alone. She sent emails to his mailbox every week to state her thinking and ask for his accompaniment, but never received reply of satisfaction. Tired of his explanation that he must obey the orders, she filed for divorce.

　Because he desired to get their holy affection back, he set other affairs aside. He trimmed his fingernails short and changed his overweight figure as well as his awful haircut. He wore an apron to prepare delicious cuisine for her. He also bought her a necklace and piles of flowers hoping that their receiver could turn around.

　　After being tested out for 3 months in all, he eventually succeeded.

　作为一名才华出众的海军军官，他注定是要忙碌的。当他的妻子打来电话宣布和他离婚的警告时，他还在查看一台数码计数器核对数据，以对一种生物化学武器的理论框架做出评估。他的下级职员表现出的同情使他很尴尬。

　他的妻子是一位非全日性工作的职员，有了他的高津贴，她住在一所装饰有优雅垫子和寝具的富丽堂皇的屋子里。她的爱好是坐在扶手椅上读读明星们的传记或一些有没完没了章节的荒谬小说。别人都很妒忌她安逸的生活，但是实际上，她厌透了被独自丢下。她每周都给他的邮箱发电子邮件陈述她的想法，要求他的陪伴，但却从未收到满意答复。受够了他总是必须服从命令的解释，她提出了离婚。

　因为渴望重新获得这份神圣的爱，他把别的事务都放在一边。他剪短了指甲，改变了超重的身材和糟糕的发型，还穿上围裙为她做可口的菜肴，他甚至还给她买了项链和成堆的鲜花，希望它们的接受者能够回心转意。

　　在被考验了总共3个月后，他最终成功了。

 

 

## 33、Mark and a Seal（马克和海豹）

　　Mark rented an accommodation with his pension near the shore. He paid annual visits there to enjoy the vivid beauty in the depths of the pure sea.

　Once, with his underwater telescope and flashlight, Mark dived along the boundary between the steep reef and the area of seaweed conservation. Suddenly, an awesome Antarctic seal with sharp teeth appeared opposite him. Every cell in his body was scared to death. But soon, he was aware that he wasn’t the target of an attack. With a neat wound in its lip caused by a shark, this grey seal was washed upside down by the tides time after time. But it tried to jog Mark as if to urge him to help it. So Mark abandoned fleeing away. With its teamwork, Mark used a net to drag the seal to the shallow water. Without pausing he helped it out after a simple operation and settled it in a narrow cave by the seaside. Every time he brought it tasty fish, it would yell and suck his hands happily. Witnesses said their anecdotes reflected a magic dimension of the relationship between humans and animals.

马克用他的退休金在海岸边租了一间住所，每年都去那儿欣赏纯净的大海深处那生动的美丽。

　有一次，马克带着他的水下望远镜和手电筒，潜到陡峭的暗礁和海草保护区间的分界线。突然，一只长着尖利牙齿、使人畏惧的南极海豹出现在他对面。马克吓坏了，但是很快，他就意识到，他不是攻击的目标。这只灰色海豹的唇上有道鲨鱼咬出的整齐伤口，还时不时地被潮水冲得头上脚下。尽管如此，它却总是努力轻轻碰撞马克，似乎在催促他帮助它。于是马克放弃了逃跑。在这只海豹的合作下，马克用一张网把它拖到浅水区，并毫不停歇给它动了一个简单的手术，帮助它解决了问题，然后将它安置在海边一个狭窄的洞里。每次当马克给它带来鲜美可口的鱼时，它就会高兴地大声叫唤，还吮吸他的手。目击者都说他们的轶事映射出人与动物关系中奇妙的一个方面。

 

 

 

 

## 34、Helping the Remote Village（援助山村）

　　A year ago, the famous astronaut received an invitation by airmail from a remote village. Intending to sniff some fresh air, he and his interpreter paid a fortnight visit there. It was a privilege for them to be there, but they were shocked by what they saw. The tracks were muddy. The river was drying up. Most villagers only possessed one broom, a few tins and several jars and their rectangular grass huts with round angles were surrounded by weeds. Besides, their school had no roof and platform, and the students had no concept of clicking a computer at all. They were badly in need.

　Soon, the astronaut made a generous voluntary donation to the village. There were textbooks for students, sewing machines for tailors and tractors for farmers. His distribution catalogue also included operating a clinic and a trunk library, as well as giving weekly lessons to teach relevant farming knowledge like how to dry out seeds or raise oxen. He himself not only helped do some paperwork but also purchased grills for boys to toast potatoes and combs for girls who were dying to get one. The other day, he heard from the villagers again inviting him to participate in the donation anniversary. For political and security reasons, he couldn’t adjust his outgoing arrangement-otherwise he would go. But his deeds were remembered forever.

　一年前，那位著名的宇航员收到一份由一个偏远村庄通过航空邮件寄来的邀请。因为想要呼吸一下新鲜空气，他和翻译到那儿做了一次两周的访问。当地之行使他们倍感荣幸，但却震惊于所见所闻。泥泞的道路、河流干枯，大部分的村民拥有的财产只不过是一只扫帚、几个瓶瓶罐罐而已，圆角的矩形草屋四周长满了杂草，学校也没有屋顶和讲台，学生们更对点击操作电脑毫无概念。他们生活确实相当困难。

　很快，宇航员就向村庄做了慷慨的自愿捐赠。捐赠品中有给学生的课本，给裁缝的缝纫机，还有给农民的拖拉机。捐赠金的分配目录中还包括一间诊所和一间书箱图书馆的运作，并有传授像怎么使种子干透，或者怎么养牛这种相关农业知识的每周课程。他自己不仅亲自帮助做一些文书工作，还给男孩子们购买了烤马铃薯的烤架、给渴望得到梳子的女孩子们买了梳子。前几天，他又收到了村民们邀请他参加捐赠周年会的来信。出于政治和安全原因，他无法调整外出时间安排，否则他就会去了。不过他所做的一切村民们都永远记得。

 

 

## 35、Study in America（留学美国）

　　Nannan’s father runs an enterprise near the Ming Tombs selling batteries and drills to the Daqing Oilfield. Hoping to get the qualification to help govern it, Nannan made much preparation and then left her motherland with her visa to study in America. Having reached her destination, she settled in an inn recommended by the travel agent.

As far as Nannan was concerned, she always kept it up in China. But she had to acknowledge it was not easy to adjust herself to the new academic requirements, which were not parallel with China’s. Though she was occupied with lectures and seminars day in and day out, the essays she drafted were still contradicted by her tutors. As for her routine life, she felt that it was hard to fit in, too. For example, she found English idioms difficult to understand. And it was out of the question to eat delicious Chinese foods though many optional cafeterias served abundant substitutes. In addition, she had to wait in a queue early for the minibus that took her to school and it was usually so cold that she felt numb. What bothered her most was that she received no apology when her sleeping was disturbed by a barking dog in a shopkeeper’s cage.

　Luckily, with her parents comforting her by videophone, she became autonomous soon and eventually got her bachelor’s degree successfully.

　　楠楠的父亲在明陵附近经营一家企业，销售电池和钻机到大庆油田。抱着获得相应资格帮助管理的希望，楠楠做了大量准备，然后带着签证离开祖国去美国留学。抵达目的地后，她在一间旅行代理推荐的旅馆安顿下来。

　就楠楠而言，她在国内一直保持着良好的状态，但是在国外，她却不得不承认，要适应新学院的要求不容易，它们和国内的要求不相同。尽管她整天都忙着听讲座、参加研讨会努力学习，她起草的论文还是被导师驳了回来。至于日常生活，她也感觉难于适应，例如，她发觉英语成语很难理解，而且不可能吃到地道的中国食品，尽管可选的许多餐馆都有提供丰富的替代品。此外，她还得冒着把人冻得麻木的寒冷早起排队等小型巴士去学校。最使她烦恼的是，一名店主笼子里的狗的吠叫闹得她睡不好觉，但却没有任何人向她道歉。

　幸运的是，在她父母通过可视电话的安慰下，她很快就锻炼得自主独立起来，并最终成功获得了学士学位。

 

 

 

## 36、Immigrate to America（移民美国）

　　Attracted by the boom in America, my nephew teamed up with a Korean to illegally cross the Bearing Strait in the Arctic to America. To avoid the Customs’ punishment, they hid in a small ferry called the North Pole Seagull, sitting back to back without sleeping, showering and shaving for 3 days, and had no chance to mourn their lost luggage when landing. The hardship of this crossing was apparent.　At first, he made a living by means of raising cattle and then was hired in aircraft industries. He lived in a Catholic district. Taking in a small percentage of Pakistani immigrants, the majority of the residents were from Italy and Denmark, who all kept up their customs and cultures. Different blocks here were distinctly marked out and indicated from the racial angle. It was unfair and needed reforming. But with nowhere else to go, my nephew lived on and managed to make a life for himself.

　My nephew’s fortune came when he bravely helped a conductor brake a ream to stop it  from slipping out of the rails. The man was elected vice chairman of the Socialist Party later. It occurred to my nephew that he could grasp this opportunity to ask for his help. The man who was thankful helped him apply to the civil authority for the right to live in America by inserting his brave deed into his documents. Unlike a great many other applicants, his application was approved by the Federal Justice Ministry. Before long, he started his own bakery and lived a better life.

因为受到美国繁荣的吸引，我的侄子与一名韩国人合作，从北极的白令海峡偷渡到美国。为了避开海关的惩处，他们躲在一艘叫“北极海鸥”的渡轮里，背靠背坐着，整整3天没有睡觉、洗澡和刮胡子，上岸的时候也没有机会心痛他们丢失的行李，这次横渡的艰辛是显而易见的。

起初，他借助饲养牲畜谋生，后来受雇于飞机制造工业。他住的地方是一个天主教区，除了包括一小部分(百分比)的巴基斯坦移民，大部分的居民都来自于意大利和丹麦，他们都保持着自己的风俗和文化，使这里的街区都从种族的角度清楚地划出界线，明确标示。这很不公平，极需改革，但我的侄子没别的地方可去，只好继续居住下去，想法设法开始新的生活。

我侄子的好运在他勇敢地帮助一名列车员刹停一列电车以防止其滑出轨道时到来了。那个人后来被选为社会党的副主席，我侄子就想到应该抓住机会请求他的帮助。这个人充满感激，立即把我侄子的勇敢事迹插入到申请文件中，帮助我侄子向美国国内政权当局申请美国居住权。不像别的许多申请人，我侄子的申请很快被联邦司法部批准了。不久，他就开了自己的面包店，过上了稍好一点的生活。

 

## 37、Be Careful about Cloning（谨慎对待克隆）

　　After a series of initial experiments and corrections, the scientist’s hard work paid off when the twin clone turkeys were hatched with normal feather and claws. This breakthrough possibly enabled people to bring their adored pets back to life. However, it bothered him from time to time that their health was in poor condition because they were unable to resist illnesses. This drawback cast him down. Merely 2 weeks later, the clones and their carrier died, which struck frustration into his heart. He retired before he attained his ambition and became a member of an opera chorus to relieve his depression.

　Shortly afterwards, the media published a conservative argument objecting to cloning owing to moral problems, and suggested the constitution include compulsory regulations to forbid obtaining commercial profits from cloning.

　When interviewed, the scientist stared at the decorations on the ceiling, thinking for a while, and then said, “I’m not in favour of any arbitrary assumption, but undertaking cloning does differ from the straightforward procedure of making loafs out of flour. Until we accumulate enough exact knowledge, any practice is in vain and is bound to fail. Altogether, being more careful is reasonable or we may walk into a side road.”

　在最初一系列的实验和修正之后，科学家的辛苦工作终于取得了成功，一对双生的克隆火鸡孵化出来，羽毛和爪子都很正常。这一突破或许能让人们使他们喜爱的宠物死而复生。然而，使他不时地烦恼的是，因为它们无法抵抗疾病，使得它们的健康状况极差。这个缺点让他很沮丧。仅仅过了2个星期，克隆体和母体都死亡了，这使他内心里充满了挫折，他也因此在达到自己目标前就退休了，并选择加入歌剧合唱团来减轻消沉的感觉。

　之后不久，媒体就因为道德问题而发表了反对克隆的保守论点，并且建议宪法应该包括强制性的法规禁止通过克隆获得商业利益。

当被采访时，科学家盯着天花板上的装饰物思考了一会儿，说：“我不赞成任何任意的假设，但是从事克隆与用面粉制作面包的简单过程确实不大相同。在我们积累了足够的准确知识前，任何实际操作都是徒劳无功的，注定会失败。总而言之，更加谨慎地对待克隆是合理的，否则我们或许会误入歧途。”

 

 

 

 

## 38、Strange Patent Applications（奇怪的专利申请）

I set about working in the current Patent Office after resigning from the court personnel. Competent and dynamic, I never feel passive while diving into the identifications of whether applications are valid and practical according to the new version of the criteria.。

With the expectation of distinguishing their own importance, some people leave the beaten track and file strange products with us now and then, for example, lantern that can be attached on your forehead, cubic walnuts, refrigerator made of straw and glue, perfume that nobody can bear to smell, and so on.

　Once, a man made a triangle helicopter out of stainless wires and string. He called us up and merrily claimed it was stable and convenient to use, and never out of order. I asked him to hang on, but this innocent man just rang off and set out to fly from his courtyard. I dialed his number in the directory trying to ring him back, but never got through.

　Merciful God blessing, an abrupt freezing rainfall made his powder wet. Luckily, the trouble was without any extension except that he crashed into a greengrocer’s making all the ripe fruits become messy jam. When people seized this crazy man with caution and sobered him by tapping his face, he complained about the bad weather instead of associating his failure with his unscientific design.　　  

有一次，有个人用不锈钢丝和绳子制作了一架三角形的直升飞机。他致电给我们，高兴地声称其确实牢固，而且方便使用，从不发生故障。我请他稍等，但这个天真的人挂了电话就开始从院子里起飞。我拨打他在电话簿上的号码试图回电给他，却无法接通。

为了显示与众不同，时不时就有人违反常规，向我们提交一些奇怪的产品申请，例如固定在前额的信号灯、立方体的胡桃、用稻草和胶水制作的冰箱、没人能受得了的香水等

从法院人事部辞职后，我开始在现在的专利局工作。我工作起来既称职又有活力，在投身于根据新版的申请标准鉴定专利申请，以防他们无效或不实用时，我从未感觉到消极没劲

　仁慈的上帝保佑，一场突然降临的冻雨打湿了他的火药，使他造成的麻烦没有扩大，只是撞入一间水果店，把所有成熟的水果都压成一塌糊涂的果酱。当人们小心地抓住这个失去理智的人，轻轻拍打他的脸使他清醒过来时，他还在抱怨糟糕的坏天气，却没有将他的失败与他不科学的设计联系起来。

 

## 39、Pronunciation and Status（口音与身份）

　　An ambassador and a referee were consulting a professor on the caption of a Buddhistic alphabet when a sobbing woman stopped them to sell an antique musical bathtub. Her dirty garment and the handkerchief around her waist were badly in need of sending to a laundry. The ambassador uncomfortably gave her a handful of pence from his wallet and said, “Take this fortune away, troublesome woman.”

　　When her figure faded away, the brilliant professor said, “You are mistaken and your improper remark on her should be condemned. In terms of this extraordinary woman, you can’t classify her status by her horrible clothes or disgusting nails. Her clean woolen vest and stockings, especially her classic pronunciation, all suggested her upper status.” The ambassador gave a whistle in amazement, and advised making her acquaintance. The professor hesitated for a while, then compromised.

　The outcome was that she was an authentic superior police officer. When they were shown in her office and saw her once more, she brought them a teapot of tea and some cookies, laughing and saying, “I rubbed some cream and wax on my garment and passed myself off as a shabby woman among thieves and robbers to investigate a plot. Generally speaking, your overlooking me and my adaptation are the best help. But my pronunciation seemed to have betrayed me.”

　　一位大使和一位裁判正在就一张佛教符号表的文字说明请教教授，这时，一名哭哭啼啼的女人把他们拦住，要卖给他们一个古董音乐澡盆，她肮脏的衣服和腰间的手帕都急需送到洗衣店清洗。大使很不舒服地从钱包里掏出一把便士说：“把这大笔钱拿走，麻烦的女人!”

　　等她的身影渐渐远去，那位才华横溢的教授说：“你错了，你对她不适当的评论语应该受到谴责。就这个不同寻常的女人来说，你不能根据她糟糕的衣服或令人恶心的指甲给她的身份地位分类。她干净的羊毛背心和袜子，尤其是她一流的发音，都暗示着她的上层身份。”大使惊奇地吹了声口哨，建议去认识她。教授犹豫了一会儿，最后妥协了。

　　结果呢，她真的是一位高级警官。当他们被带进她的办公室再次见到她时，她给他们拿来一壶茶和一些饼干，笑着说：“我把奶油和蜡涂在大衣上假扮成寒酸肮脏的女人混进在小偷和抢劫犯中间，是为了调查一宗阴谋。通常说来，你们对我的忽视和我对此的适应就是最好的帮助。但是我的发音似乎暴露了我啊。”

 

 

## 40、A Sly Murder（一宗狡猾的谋杀案）

When giving a lecture about the significance of punctuation, the academic professor was interrupted and arrested by the police for murdering his wife, a receptionist of a kindergarten. The police found some photos he deleted from their e-album showing that they used to have a gay life. But, fed up with her wrinkled face, he murdered her instead of divorcing her to avoid fortune division. He cut up a kind of seashell with a sharpened knife, and hammered it into powder on a skateboard, and made at most one gram, which was enough to accelerate one’s pulse until he or she dies. This kind of poison can date back to 10,000 BC when people rubbed it on spears to kill beasts. The professor mixed the poison with onion, watermelon and yogurt for his wife. Howling and scratching her chest, she felt dizzy and died soon.

After tentative examination, the police assumed she died of heart disease. But systematic botanical analyses showed that the watermelon spit on the messy mat and the quilt was poisonous. Regardless of exhaustion and starvation, the acute and skilful policemen used radioactive equipment to make sure the category of the poison. Primitive and not ample as their alternative equipment was, they got perfect accuracy somehow.　People applauded the police and the woman’s family can look ahead with relief now.

那位学院的教授在发表关于标点符号重要意义的演讲时被警察打断了，他因谋杀自己的妻子——一位幼儿园的接待员——而被逮捕。警察找到了一些被他从电子相册里删除的照片，照片表明，他们曾经有过快乐的生活，但是，因为厌烦了妻子起皱的脸，他杀死她而不是和她离婚以避免离婚时的财产分割。他用一把磨利的小刀切碎一种贝壳，然后在滑板上锤打成粉末，最多1克就足以加速人的脉搏直到其死亡。这种毒药可以追溯到公元前10，000年，当时它就被涂抹在长予上杀死野兽。教授把这种毒药混合在洋葱、西瓜和酸奶里给他的妻子，后者叫喊、抓挠胸口、头晕目眩，很快就死了。在初步检查之后，警察设想她是死于心脏病。但是系统的植物学分析却表明，吐在凌乱的席子和被子上的西瓜有毒。敏锐而又技术娴熟的警察不顾疲劳和饥饿，用放射性的设备确定了毒素的种类。尽管可供选择的设备原始，且数量不足，他们还是设法取得了完美的准确度。

人们都为警察欢呼鼓掌，而那位女人的家人现在也可以带着欣慰为将来打算了。

 

 

##  41、A Courageous Amateur (勇敢的业余运动员)

 

He doomed to be a courageous champion. But, as his profile mentioned, he was in reality born unfit for such work. He majored in economics, and used to work as a receptionist, an accountant, a lawyer, and a politician. Producing scarfs, zips, underwear and overcoats, his successful company offered workers high wage and salary. People appreciated his tact, wisdom, virtue and noble deeds. But he attained spiritual satisfaction from none of these. Only conventional sports fascinated him, such as hurdling, boxing, triathlon, and diving from a springboard approximate meters high. 

 

He started his entire conception with bidding to accomplish the extremely tough marathon as an amateur. Through meditation, he used soul to urge himself and guide his body adjustment. Though he vomited every time he lunged or somersaulted, though his gymnastics was treated as juggling and caused laughter, he practised hard. He regretted that he didn’t start earlier. Therefore, his sacred motivation of devotion to sports was to live without repentance.(157 words/ 56 new)

 

他注定是一位勇敢的冠军。但是，正如他简历中所提到的，他实际上从出生起就不太健康。他主修经济学，曾经当过招待员、会计、律师、还有政治家。他的公司很成功，生产围巾、拉链、内衣和外套，为工人提供高工资（薪水）。人们都很欣赏他的机敏、智慧、美德和高尚的行为。但是他却没有由此获得精神上的满足，只有那些传统的运动才使他入迷，比如跨栏、拳击、三项全能，还有从约10米高的跳板上一跃入水。

他以业余运动员的身份申请完成极端艰难的马拉松比赛，就此开始了他的整个计划。通过冥想，他用精神推动和调节身体。尽管他每次冲刺时都呕吐不已，尽管他的体能训练总是被当作耍把戏，引来笑话，他依然努力练习。他很后悔没有更早开始锻炼，因此，他全身心投入运动的神圣动机就是：不后悔地生活。

 

## 42、A Hard Expedition 一次艰难的远征

In 1662, an expedition to the North Pole set loose from the equator. The Encyclopedia records the background to this exploration. After outward departure at dusk, the crew deposited their parcels and did their routine. But they couldn’t reckon the precise latitude. And the magnetic compass was awkward and not reliable. So they used horizon, celestial objects overhead, seaweed, tide and logs with a knotted rope as reference. To avoid being on a random course heading nowhere, they even sailed alongside cliffs, whose shortcomings were obvious. 

 

Gradually, the crew, who were at the mercy of the sea and roaring wind when offshore, lost way. The dilemma lasted long. Starvation and thirst caused psychological tension. Foreseeing the minimum chance of escaping the jaw of death, they ignored seabirds’ swooping to tear and peck them. With so many hardships and drawbacks, their survival was a miracle. 

 

This incident increased the tendency of a compulsory reform on nautical equipment for secure voyage. Portable equipment was simplified and updated.( 164 words/61 new)

 

1662年，一支远征队从赤道向北极出发，百科全书记载了这次探险的背景。

船只在黄昏时分启程，船员们放好包裹，开始执行日常事务。但是他们无法计算准确的纬度，磁性指南针也很难操作，不太可靠，因此，他们使用地平线、头顶上的天体、海草、潮汐和绑有打结绳子的圆木做航线参考。为了避免过于随意的航线把他们带到不知名的地方，他们甚至还沿着悬崖航行，这样做的据点是显而易见的。

渐渐地，离开海岸后就完全受大海和呼啸的风主宰的船员们迷了路。这种困境持续了很长时间，饥饿和口渴引起了心理的紧张不安。因为预见到很难有（最低的）机会从鬼门关逃脱，他们连海鸟扑下来撕扯、啄食他们的身体都不理会。经历了那么多的艰难和险阻，他们能够培育幸存下来真是奇迹。

这一事件促进了为了安全航海、必须革新航海设备的趋势，便找携设备由此得到了简化和更新换代。

## 43、Welcome to Australia (欢迎到澳洲来)

Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the Australian Day celebration and enjoy the barbecue. Then our travel along the highway winding down the Cradle Mountain via rusty rock barriers will let you see huge enclosures. Farmers have completed sowing. Owing to adequate rainfall, you’ll enjoy the splendour of the superb tropical agriculture as well. The fortnight timetables are in the travel brochures. 

 

The Commonwealth of Australia has six autonomous states. The federal government is responsible for its defence, foreign policy and taxation. Most citizens of this nation are migrants from different birthplaces. Often corresponding with their homelands, they associate Oceania with the world. The aboriginal reservations used to shrink because the authority snatched the land. These desperate people owed their survival to tolerance. So, out of respect for their ancestors, every bachelor will be talked into learning to protect heir heritage. 

 

Australian ecology is unique. Amongst the creatures, some are dangerous. For example, if your limb is paralyzed by a venomous funnelweb spider, go to see a doctor before you become unconscious. Remember, vinegar can’t help you recover from the sickness. Thank you.(174 words/53 new)

 

女士们先生们：欢迎参加澳洲日庆典，请享受我们的烧烤野餐。接着我们就会沿着蜿蜓下摇篮山的高速路，经过锈色岩石屏障前行，你将会看见巨大的围场。此外，农民们已经完成了播种，你还可以欣赏到充足降雨滋润下宏伟的热带农业所呈现的壮观。我们两星期的时间表在旅行手册里有。

澳大利亚有6个自治州，联邦政府负责防务、对外政策和税收。这个国家大多数的公民都是来自不同出生地的移民。由于经常与家乡通信联络，他们把大洋洲与世界紧密联系在一起。原著民的保留地曾经大量缩减，因为当局抢走了他们的土地，这些绝望的人们把他们的得以幸存归功于他们极大的忍耐力。因此，出于对祖先的尊敬，原著民中的每个单身汉都将被说服要学习如何保护他们珍贵的遗产。

澳大利亚的生态是独一无二的。在当地的生物中，有些是很危险的。例如，如果你的肢体被漏斗蜘蛛单板机痹，一定要在失去意识前去看医生。记住，醋是不能帮助你从这样的疾病中康复的。谢谢大家！

 

## 44、The Exotic Plants from China (从中国来的外来植物)

 

When getting rid of the rotten weeds for the daisy in your courtyard or on your balcony with a spade, do you know it is an exotic plant? As a monument near a pyramid in Egypt shows, collecting exotic plants dates back to around ,00BC. In the th century, European missionaries and botanists anchored in the Yellow Sea and did their endeavor to collect typical Chinese plants on a large scale, such as dove trees which appealed to them very much. The difficulties they met included thunderstorms, restrictions on their movement and conflicts with pirates, who carried spears and never shaved their beards. Their fluency in Chinese helped them a lot. To lower the death rate of the plants, they used strings to fix plants in tightly sealed containers, which were attached to other goods and shipped back to distant Europe. 

 

However, a problem appeared. Among these plants, some gave out a delicate or fragrant odour to attract particular beetles or wasps. Some gave out a fruity or musty smell to attract certain bats and moths, while other odourless plants with dull petals used the nectar inside their tubes to attract humming-birds. Without these pollinators which evolved together with the plants to pollinate for them, most plants postponed to get ripe despite enough irrigation.(209 words/ 55 new)

 

当你用铲子给你院子里或阳台上的雏菊除去腐烂的杂草时，你知道它是外来植物吗？ 正如一座埃及金字塔旁的纪念碑所记载，收集外来植物可追溯到公元前1500年。在18世纪，欧洲的植物学家在黄海抛锚停泊，努力大规模收集典型的中国植物，例如鸽子树，就非常吸引他们。他们遇见的困难包括雷暴天气，行动的限制，还有与拿长矛、留胡子的海盗发生的冲突。好在流利的中文给了他们很大的帮助。为了降低植物的死亡率，他们用细绳把植物固定在紧紧密封的容器里，然后附加在别的货物上运回遥远的欧洲。

然而，有个问题出现了。在这些植物中，有些散发出微妙的或芬芳的气味吸引特定的甲是或黄蜂，有些释放出果味或霉味吸引某种蝙蝠或蛾，而另一些无味、花瓣颜色也不鲜明的动植物则用他们花管中的花蜜引来蜂鸟。没有这些与植物共同进化的虫媒来给它们授粉，即使给予充分的灌溉，这些植物还是大部分都延迟成熟了。

 

## 45、Beware of Advertisements （小心广告）

 

Corporations all have budget for the expense of advertisements to promote sales. Billboards over lanes, stereo broadcast and television are their media. The sales partly rely on ads. However, not all advertisers have conscience. Thus, misleading, dishonest, or even immoral ads generated everywhere. They use visual technique to turn bad things, such as drinking litres of alcoholic drinks and smoking tobacco, into decent fashion, which, in fact, is murdering you slowly. Consumers have no use for these ads which don’t fit in (with) the ethics and should be banned to protect our ethical basis.

 

Once, a mature actress was appointed to play a typist, wearing a casual garment in a typewriter ad. Her fluent statement informed the target audience of the feature that the suitcase-sized product could raise the speed of typing on sheets of paper. A hostess of a party was misled and bought one to type her invitations. Thought the spokesman of the producer apologized later, she felt offended, and the actress could never refresh her worthy fame. So, beware. If you see any untrustworthy ads, please dial the number of the Consumer Association. The operator will connect you to the chairman directly and give you response soon.( 199 words/ 58 new)

 

公司企业都有做促销广告的费用预算，车道上的广告牌、立体声广播和电视都是他们的媒体。产品的销售在一定程度上要依靠广告。然而，不是所有的登广告者都有道德心。这样，误导的、不诚实的、甚至不道德的广告就到处产生了。他们用视觉上的技巧把喝酒、抽烟等坏的东西变成正派的时尚，实际上却是对你的慢性谋杀。消费者厌恶这些不符合道德的广告，他们应该被禁止，以保护我们的道德基础。

一次，一位老练的女演员被指定在一个打印机广告中扮演打字员，她穿着休闲服装，用流利的表达告知目标观众，这台手提箱大小的产品具有能够提高在纸张上打印速度的特点。有位要举办晚会的女主人被误导了，购买了一台拓印邀请函。尽管制造商的发言人人后来道了歉，她还是深感受伤，而且那位女演员也再无法恢复她原本可敬的名声。所以，要小心。如果你看见了不可靠的广告，请拨打消费者协会的电话号码，接线员将直接转拉给协会主席，并尽快给你答复。

 

## 46、The stout captain （顽强的船长）

 

As the proverb said, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hooked by the caption’s advertisement, the writer gave up his cosy life and grasped the chance to secretly get aboard the ship, which was full of spider webs. Luckily, being tactful, he was liked by the captain and, later, became a chef of no rank after overcoming seasickness.

 

When the ship was crushed by ice, it was so urgent that there was no time to mourn. With God’s blessing, the stewards collected enough stoves, foods, and bedding. Foreseeing the unbearable suffering, the stout captain asked his men to swear to do as he advocated: keep cheerful and never give way to feeling discouraged. He also set out a fair framework for their life to reduce selfish deeds, odd behaviours or unfair punishment. His perseverance and optimism were vital to strengthen their faith of survival and morale. Then, without delay, having given his commitment to return, the captain selected loyal and dynamic stewards to bring help.

 

Living in this freezing circumstance needed special caution and endurance. Booming blasts of wind, which the small huts couldn’t block out, made them breathless. Everyone suffered from sun-blindness and blackened rotten toes. They were bored with seal meat and liver, their regular and unchangeable food, which made their stool rather hard. Burning seal fat gave off black smoke which caused everyone to have hoarse voices.

 

Anyhow, they survived and was filled with gratitude for their admirable captain.(233word/62new)

 

正如谚语所说：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，作者被那船长的广告给迷住了，毅然放弃了舒适的生活，偷偷地抓住机会爬上满是蜘蛛网的船。幸运的是，船长喜欢他的言行得体，在克服了晕船后，他成为一名没有衔职的厨师。

当船被冰挤碎时，情况相当紧急，根本没有难过的时间。上帝保佑，乘务员们收集了足够的炉子、食物和被褥。由于预见到难以忍受的艰难困苦，顽强的船长让船员们发誓按他主张的那样去做：保持愉快，永不向气馁低头让步。他还为他们建立起公平的生活框架，以减少自私的行为、古怪的举动、或者不公平的惩罚。他的坚持不懈我乐观精神对增强船员生存的信念和士气是至关重要的。接着，船长毫不迟延地挑选了5名忠实而又精力充沛的船员出发去寻求帮助，并许诺一定会回来救留下的人。

生活在这个严寒的环境里需要特别的小心和忍耐力。小棚屋阻挡不住发出轰隆声的阵风，让他们几乎喘不过气来。人人都长了腐料变黑的脚趾，都烦透了海豹肉和海豹肝，这样天天如此、一成不变的食物使他们便秘，而且燃烧海豹油散发出来的黑烟，使每个人的声音都嘶哑不堪。

但是无论如何，所有人都幸存了下来，船长赢得了大家的钦佩和感激。

## 47、The Story Carved on an Armchair (刻在扶手椅上的故事)

 

After the bank confirmed the signature on behalf of the seller and cashed the cheque for him, the armchair belonged to Mr. White. He was very fond of this ancient opera prop found in a vacant storage of an old lord. Hoping to make a name by modernizing the ancient Latin carved on the armchair, he packed up his baggage and shortened his journey. His new terminal was home now. Though allergic to dust, he scratched away the dusty surface himself. Then, sneezing, he read an old story whose author was a famous play writer:

Long ago, an old emperor wanted to hand over the burden of responsibility. He decided to allocate his kingdom to his three darling daughters. Whichever of them adored him most would get the best part. The deceitful flattery of the two elder greedy and cunning daughters won his trust. But the honest youngest daughter, though her father prayed that she would say something, responded that she had nothing special to say. Suspecting whether she really cared for him, the emperor redrew boundaries on the map and distributed nothing to her. Then, he drove his innocent little daughter to France, where she luckily met her bridegroom.

 

Forecasting that the emperor was causing friction between him and his daughters, a loyal duke spoke out his opinion to oppose the decision. The emperor demanded that he leave and did not hear out his contradictions.

 

After the emperor gave away the majesty, his two daughters and their staff became disrespectful to him. They insulted him and scolded that his troops were corrupt and filled with drunken soldiers, which was not true.

 

Finally, the youngest daughter came back and defeated her two sisters on the frontier. She put the old emperor back on his throne. And the loyal duke’s sacrifice was rewarded.

This story was adapted to so wonderful a film that it is, beyond question , worth rewinding to see a second time.(316words/65new)

 

在银行代表卖方确认了签名并兑现了支票，扶手椅就属于怀特先生了。他非常喜欢这件歌剧用的古老道具，它是在一位老地主空荡荡的储藏室里发现的。带着通过把扶手椅上雕刻的古拉丁文译成现代（化）文而成名的希望，他立刻收拾行李，缩短行程，现在，他的新终点站是回家。尽管对灰尘过敏，他还是亲自刮去满是灰尘的表层，接着，他一边不住地打喷嚏，一边读到了一篇古老的故事，作者是一位著名的戏剧作家：

很久以前，有位年老的国王想要移交责任的重担，决定将他的王国分给三个亲爱的女儿，哪个最爱他，哪个就获得最好的一份。两个贪婪而狡猾的大姐用不诚实的恭维骗得了他的信任。但是诚实的小女儿在父亲的恳求下却回答说她说不出什么特别的话。因为怀疑她是否真的关心自己，国王重新在地图上画边界，没有分给她任何东西，然后把自己无辜的小女儿赶到法国。幸运的是，她在法国遇见了后来成为她新郎的人。由于预见到国王在自己和女儿之间引发了矛盾，一位忠心耿耿的公爵大胆说出了反对意见。国王没有听完他反驳的话就命令把他赶出了自己的国界。

在国王把王权送出之后，他的两个女儿和手下却开始不尊敬他了。他们侮辱他，责骂他的军队既腐败，又整天喝得醉熏熏，但这其实都不是真的。

最后，小女儿回来打败了她的两个姐姐，把年迈的国王又扶上了王位，公爵的牺牲也获得了回报。

这个故事后来被改编成了电影，如此精彩的电影是毫无疑问值得倒回来再看第二遍的。

 

## 48、Fighting Against Racial Discrimination (与种族歧视做斗争)

 

Without the liberty to register to vote, blacks used to be dominated by whites. Even the almighty God seemed to lose sight of their prayers, so they resolved to fight against racial discrimination themselves.

 

One day, a black woman was arrested for having committed offence to white people when she was unwilling to submit the unjust separation tradition, which prohibited blacks from sitting in the white people’s seats on trolleybuses. This event was seized on by blacks to carry out a nationwide boycott against the trolleybus company.

 

Johnson, who was hopeful to transform his town into an oasis of equality and happiness, put on his sandals and hurried out. He was going to negotiate with the company. “Being punctual” was the creed he always lived out. Saluting the pedestrians marching on the pavement, he ignored the evident hostility, or even abuse, from some white people to avoid collision. His philosophy was that, one day, whites and blacks would play a beautiful symphony of brotherhood together.

 

By coincident, he met Tom, who was skimming the latest newspaper. He quoted the newspaper to tell Johnson that the Supreme Court had declared that the separation was not constitutional. Just like a bomb, his words caused a brief chaos, then a great cheer in the crowds. They knew they had won a fundamental victory in the battle for civil rights.(219words/49new)

 

因为没有登记选举的自由，黑人曾经处于被白人统治支配的地位，就连万能的上帝似乎也无视他们的祈祷，因此，他们决心靠自己和种族歧视做斗争。

有一天，一位黑人妇女因为不愿服从在无轨电车上禁止黑人坐白人位子的不公平隔离惯例而冒犯了白人，受到逮捕。黑人们抓住这一事件开展了针对电车公司的全国抵制运动。

满怀希望把小镇改变成平等、幸福乐土的约翰逊穿上他的凉鞋，匆忙赶了出去，他要去和电车公司谈判，守时一向是他坚持的信条。他一边向人行道上前进的步行者致敬，一边不理会一些白人明显的敌意，甚至是辱骂，以避免引起冲突。他的人生观告诉他，白人和黑人总有一天会一起演奏一曲美妙的手足之歌（交响乐）。

很巧，他遇见了汤姆，他正在浏览最新的报纸。他告诉约翰逊，最高法院已经宣布隔离是不符合宪法的。他的话就象一颗炸弹，在人群中引起一阵短暂的混乱，然后是大声的欢呼。他们知道，他们赢得了公民权斗争的基本胜利。

 

## 49、Don’t Assess one by His Appearance（不要以貌取人）

 

It’s frequent that we tend to assess one by his appearance, which is not always accurate.

Once, in spite of our great endeavour, the technology adopted by my brewery couldn’t efficiently prevent the beer component from going bad when the temperature was beneath degrees centigrade. So I went to attend a seminar in New Zealand to find someone to consult. I previewed the seminar manual in detail, and decided that, among all the names listed underneath the caption, Dr. Smith, a famous technician and educator, was the competent one.

Learning that I didn’t prepare local currency at the airport, a blind man asked me to share a cab with him to the Lotus Hotel. He was in shabby clothes. And his vague oral English confused me a lot. His bag was in such a messy situation inside—recipes for cuisine, tickets for ballet shows, albums, cassettes and so on, all were mixed up. Luckily, resembling other blind people, his auditory and tactile senses were acute. However, later at the seminar, I learned that he was that famous Dr. Smith.

The speeches were tiresome except Dr. Smith’s. After the seminar, he presented me a booklet with a picture of bent rainbow on the cover, and said that it was up to me to digest the advanced technology and carry it out. Finally, we succeeded.

Besides the concrete technology, my acquisition of the knowledge about how to judge people was a bonus from Dr. Smith.(244words/45new)

 

我们时常会倾向于根据外来来评定一个人，这并不总是准确的。

有一回，尽管做了极大的努力，我的啤酒厂采用的技术总不能在温度低于10摄氏度时有效地防止啤酒成分变质。因此，我去新西兰参加了一场研讨会，想找个人请教。我事先详细查看了研讨会手册并决定，在标题下开列的名字中，史密斯博士，著名的技术师和教育家，就是能胜任的人。

在机场，有位盲人得知我没有准备当地的货币后，邀请我和他坐同一辆出租车到莲花洒店。他身穿破旧的衣服，含糊的口头英语让我总是听不清楚，而且他的包里也杂乱得很——烹饪菜谱、芭蕾表演的门票、相册、磁带等等，都混杂在一起。所幸的是，他和别的盲人一样，有敏锐的听觉和触觉。然而，后来在研讨会上，我却得知，他就是那位著名的史密斯博士。

除了史密斯博士，其他人的演说都令人厌倦。会后，他送给我一本封面上有道弯弯彩虹的小册子，说，接下来由我自己好好理解消化这先进的技术并付诸实施。我们最终成功地解决了啤酒厂的问题。

除了有形的技术，获得如何判断人的知识是史密斯博士赠送的又一件特别奖励。

 

## 50、Betty was not the Burglar （贝蒂不是窃贼）

 

Betty, the black heroine of this book, was sensible, generous, outspoken and was never hopeless. Because her growth in a bungalow with a semicircle roof was a miserable experience, she had determined to struggle against prejudice and injustice since childhood. She got round all obstacles and did everything in her power to stand out, though black people were thought ill of and so many limitations were in force at that time.

 

Her initial job was keeping goods in sequence in a warehouse for storing bargains, which was possessed by an arrogant and eccentric merchant. He was so skeptical and sensitive that any try to win his trust was in vain. He always said he could see through any deception.

 

One morning, while inspecting, the merchant found some goods were lost. When enquired, Betty denied straight away that she was the burglar. But he discounted her words and insulted her with ironic words. The fact was twisted. Betty declined to make any concession against her will. Her explicit contradiction helped her win other staffs’ approval. At length, they reached a consensus that the merchant should admit his fault.

 

When giving his ambiguous apology, suddenly, the merchant heard something squeaking, and felt a claw in his collar. He fell down on a bench with terror. When he hastily pulled himself up, everyone present saw a squirrel dangling on the chain connecting the warehouse with a pine tree. That was the burglar.

 

The revelation of this event led to Betty’s becoming a famous writer and critic. In her early works of different literary genres under the name of Betty, she recounted this experience as vividly as a romance. She rejoiced to be the premier sponsor of “the Movement for Equality”. Wherever she went, her appearance always signalled the crowd to hail her achievement.(305words/73new)

 

贝蒂，本书的女主角，是一位明智、慷慨、坦言，而从不感到绝 望的黑人。她成长在一间有半圆形屋顶的平房里，那是一段痛苦的经历。正因如此，她自童年起就下定决心与对黑人的偏见和不公平做斗争。尽管当时对黑人的评价 不好，也存在那么多的限制，她还是克服了所有的障碍，竭尽全力出类拔萃。

她的第一份工作是在一间储存便宜货的仓库负责将货物按顺序摆放整齐，这间仓库由一位傲慢古怪的商人拥有。他是如此地多疑和敏感，任何想争取他信任的努力都是徒劳的。他总是说他能看穿任何诡计。

一天早晨，在视察的时候，商人发现有些货物丢失了。当询问到贝蒂时，她立即否认她是窃贼。但是她不相信她的话，还有讽刺的语言侮辱她。事实被扭曲了。贝蒂拒绝做聘书任何违心的让步，她清楚明确的反驳帮助她赢得了其他同事的支持，最后，他们达成了共识：商人应该承认错误。

当商人含糊其词地道歉时，突然，他听到什么东西吱吱地叫着，并且感觉到一只爪子伸进他的衣领。他吓得倒在长凳上。当他惊慌失措地站起来时，在场的人都看见一只松鼠正悬挂在连接仓库和一棵松树的锁链上。那才是窃贼呢！

这次事件给予贝蒂的启示，最终导致了她成为一位著名的作家和评论家，在她早期以贝蒂的名字出版的各种文学体裁的作品中，她都把这次经历叙述得如浪漫故事般生 动。她非常乐意被尊为“平等运动”的第一发起人，无论走到哪里，她的出现都是引来人们热烈欢呼的信号。
